## Intro

In this guide, you'll use a virtual machine (VM) to run an SQL database server and a web app that uses it. The VM is a Linux server system that runs on top of your own computer. You can share files easily between your computer and the VM; and you'll be running a web service inside the VM which you'll be able to access from your regular browser.

We're using tools called [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox]to install and manage the VM. You'll need to install these to do this guide. 

### Use a terminal

You'll be doing these exercises using a Unix-style terminal on your computer. If you are using a **Mac or Linux** system, your regular terminal program will do just fine. On **Windows**, I recommend using the **Git Bash** terminal that comes with the Git software. If you don't already have Git installed, download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation

### Install VirtualBox

### Install Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. [Download it from vagrantup.com.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) Install the version for your operating system.

**Windows users:** The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.


## Instructions

### Start the virtual machine

From your terminal, inside the **vagrant** subdirectory, run the command `vagrant up`. This will cause Vagrant to download the Linux operating system and install it. This may take quite a while (many minutes) depending on how fast your Internet connection is.

When `vagrant up` is finished running, you will get your shell prompt back. At this point, you can run `vagrant ssh` to log in to your newly installed Linux VM!

_Logging into the Linux VM with `vagrant ssh`._

### Logged in

If you are now looking at a shell prompt that starts with the word `vagrant` (as in the above screenshot), congratulations â€” you've gotten logged into your Linux VM.

### The files for this course

Inside the VM, change directory to `/vagrant` and look around with `ls`.

The files you see here are the same as the ones in the `vagrant` subdirectory on your computer (where you started Vagrant from). Any file you create in one will be automatically shared to the other. This means that you can edit code in your favorite text editor, and run it inside the VM.

Files in the VM's `/vagrant` directory are shared with the `vagrant` folder on your computer. But other data inside the VM is not. For instance, the PostgreSQL database itself lives only inside the VM.

### Logging out and in

If you type `exit` (or `Ctrl-D`) at the shell prompt inside the VM, you will be logged out, and put back into your host computer's shell. To log back in, make sure you're in the same directory and type `vagrant ssh` again.

If you reboot your computer, you will need to run `vagrant up` to restart the VM.

### `vagrant up` is taking a long time

Because it's downloading a whole Linux operating system from the Internet.
